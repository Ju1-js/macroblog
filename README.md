# Have you ever hit the character limit of a tweet?

by team _usernameTaken

Macroblog is a blogging platform to read and post blogs in the most open way possible.

## Portability
All macroblog posts are in markdown format. At any point, you can pick up all of your posts and move them anywhere. Another blogging site like medium.com, a self hosted website, or even just a hard drive could be the next home for the blog you start here. 

## Federation
All macroblog posts are federated over the AT protocol, meaning everything is completely open. Anyone is able to make a client that can post and read posts from any macroblog blog. Visit atproto.com to learn more about the protocol itself.
